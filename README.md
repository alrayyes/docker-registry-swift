docker-registry-swift
=====================

Docker registry with built in Swift support

The built image is available at https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/andthensome/registry-swift/

The image is based on the official registry image, but with added support for storing images on Swift.

Run a docker registry backed by a Swift datastore (e.g. on Rackspace):

```
/usr/bin/docker run --rm \
  -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=swift \
  -e OS_CONTAINER=docker-registry \
  -e OS_USERNAME=your-username \
  -e OS_PASSWORD=your-password \
  -e OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/ \
  -e OS_REGION_NAME=DFW \
  -e OS_TENANT_NAME=MossoCloudFS_nnnnn \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  --name registry \
  andthensome/registry-swift
```
